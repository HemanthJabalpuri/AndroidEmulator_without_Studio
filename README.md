Here I will tell you about setting Android Emulator and running it in different Android SDK Revisions

First we have to download Android SDK tools at https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools.  
Latest Revision as of this writing is [commandline-tools-v3.0](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-6858069_latest.zip). See its README in corressponding folder of this repo.
