Download and extract Android SDK Tools 25.2.5 from http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-linux.zip

It will contain `android` GUI tool and `emulator` in tools/ folder.  
Execute `android`.
Since it is released in [January 2017](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/sdk-tools), it may support upto Android Nougat 7.1.2(25).  
Install any `system-image` like armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64 and platforms-android-{api_level} and latest platform-tools.
Create new AVD from `Tools/Manage AVDs` section and run it.

Enjoy!
